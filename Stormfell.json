Ancient ruins and standing stones, remnants of a forgotten age, are scattered throughout the area, shrouded in ancient magic and mystery.\n\nThe outskirts serve as a gateway between the city of Stormfell and the untamed wilderness, with various paths leading to different parts of the region. An overgrown path leads to the ancient ruins to the east, while a winding road leads through the rolling hills to the north.
